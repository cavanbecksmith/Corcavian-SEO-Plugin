# Corcavian SEO Plugin
I built this plugin to easily allow me to overwrite the title and meta description for each of the pages on my wordpress site.
# Install
* Clone the repository
* Drag into your wordpress site **/wp-content/plugins** folder
* Navigate to your wordpress **plugins** page and install
* Now there should be a new menu item that has appeared that says **Corcavian SEO**
* Click on this menu and supply the link for your **Blog** posts page
